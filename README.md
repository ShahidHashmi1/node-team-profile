  ## Description

This project is intended to dynamically create an html page that displays the employees at different levels of tech organization, to access their GitHub profiles and email addresses.
<p>The motivation for this project was to make easy access or easy contact with employees at an orginzation without having to spend time searching for this contact info individually.</p>
<p>This project is a rudimentary version, but can easily be updated to include various fields or details about an employee - such as ID number, hire date, salary, etc. To scale this would be very straight-forward.</p>
<p>This project was particularly notable because of the test-driven-development strategy implemented. I had written unit tests via the node package Jest to ensure that any future code to be written would produce the desired output. The results were exactly as expected, and the utilization of Jest will certainly serve useful for future applications.</p>
